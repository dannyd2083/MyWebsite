<p>
  I am a third-year student major in computer science in UBC (The University of British Columbia)
  who has coding experience in several programming languages such as Java, C++, and C. Ever since I was a little kid, the video game has been my passion.
  I am always obsessed with those amazing characters, those beautiful worlds, and wonderful stories in different games. I am sure I am not the only one
  who thinks life is hard sometimes. But video games allow us to escape for a while, which gives us the energy to move on. I want to be the one
  who can create a world that brings happiness to people. So, now, I have learned a lot from my amazing school and I can't wait to use my knowledge to
  begin my dream. I am looking for an opportunity to apply my coding knowledge and enthusiasm at an innovative company.

        This is an academic project I created in CPSC 210(Software Construction).
        Three data structures were assigned to organize the information of students, professors, and courses.
        All the information was stored in text files as JSON objects.
        I also designed and built a graphical user interface with the JavaFX Scene Builder.
